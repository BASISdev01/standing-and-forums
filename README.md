# Notes

1. **Bangla Text on PASS ID:**
    - Implement Bangla text on the PASS ID for better localization and user understanding.

2. **Email Sending and Delivery Tracking using SendGrid API:**
    - Utilize the SendGrid API for sending emails.
    - Implement tracking mechanisms to monitor the delivery status of sent emails.
    - Retrieve and store the `X-Message-Id` from SendGrid responses for future reference.
    - Explore SendGrid's API to check the delivery status of specific emails using the stored `X-Message-Id`.

3. **Additional Considerations:**
    - Ensure proper error handling in the email sending process.
    - Log relevant information for debugging and auditing purposes.
    - Regularly review and update the implementation to align with SendGrid's latest API documentation and best practices.
